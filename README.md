## Project Overview

This project documents my learning journey in Java, focusing on various network programming models commonly used in backend development. Each section includes examples to illustrate the concepts, structured as follows:

### 1. BIO (Blocking I/O)
BIO, or Blocking I/O, is the traditional I/O model in Java. It uses blocking streams and sockets to handle network communication, where each connection is managed by a dedicated thread. This model is suitable for simpler applications but can be inefficient for high-concurrency scenarios.

#### Key Features:
- Blocking calls, where each client connection is handled in a dedicated thread.
- Suitable for small-scale applications with lower concurrency requirements.

#### Example:
In this project, the BIO example demonstrates a simple server-client interaction where the server accepts a client connection, processes the request, and responds. This approach is easy to understand but can become resource-intensive as the number of clients increases.

### 2. NIO (Non-blocking I/O)
Java NIO introduces non-blocking I/O and buffer-oriented data handling, suitable for applications that need to handle many connections simultaneously without dedicating a separate thread to each connection. NIO provides efficient mechanisms for I/O operations by using channels, buffers, and selectors.

#### Key Features:
- Non-blocking channels that allow a single thread to handle multiple connections.
- Selector-based model, enabling a single thread to manage multiple channels.
- Useful for high-concurrency applications, where the server needs to handle many connections without excessive thread management.

#### Examples:
- **Demo 1**: Basic non-blocking I/O with channels.
- **Demo 2**: Multiplexing with selectors to manage multiple channels in a single thread.
- **Demo 3**: Asynchronous file transfer using nested `CompletionHandler` callbacks.
- **Demo 4**: Data serialization using `ByteBuffer`, focusing on efficient object-to-byte array conversion for high-performance network protocols.

### 3. Netty
Netty is a high-performance, asynchronous event-driven framework for building scalable network applications. It builds on NIO and provides a simplified API with additional features for handling protocols, managing connections, and implementing custom encoding and decoding.

#### Key Features:
- Built on top of NIO, with added abstractions to manage complex I/O patterns.
- Supports high concurrency and scales well with non-blocking, asynchronous operations.
- Commonly used for building custom protocols, web servers, and distributed applications.

#### Examples:
- **Basic**: Simple Netty server-client setup to establish a basic connection and message exchange.
- **Echo**: Echo server that returns received messages to the client, demonstrating request-response patterns.
- **Heartbeat**: Heartbeat mechanism using `IdleStateHandler` to detect and handle idle connections for connection stability.
- **File Transfer**: Implements file transfer using zero-copy (`FileRegion`), allowing efficient file sending between server and client.
- **WebSocket Chat**: WebSocket-based chat server for real-time message broadcasting among multiple clients connected to a WebSocket endpoint.

### 4 Concurrency
This section covers Javaâ€™s concurrency model, focusing on the tools provided by the java.util.concurrent package. It includes examples of thread creation, synchronization, atomic operations, concurrent collections, and the Fork/Join framework, along with various utilities for thread coordination and communication.

#### Key Features:
* Thread Creation: Different approaches to creating and managing threads, including implementing Runnable, extending Thread, and using thread pools.
* synchronization and Locks: Techniques for ensuring safe access to shared resources, including synchronized blocks and reentrant locks.
* Atomic Operations: Using atomic classes like AtomicInteger, AtomicReference, and AtomicStampedReference to perform non-blocking updates. 
* Concurrent Collections: Collections like ConcurrentHashMap, ConcurrentLinkedQueue, CopyOnWriteArrayList, and BlockingQueue to handle concurrent access efficiently. 
* Communication Utilities: Classes like CountDownLatch, CyclicBarrier, Semaphore, and Exchanger for managing complex thread interactions. 
* Fork/Join Framework: Parallel processing of large tasks by dividing them into smaller subtasks, particularly useful for recursive algorithms.

#### Examples:
* Thread Creation: Demonstrates various ways to create threads, including Runnable, Callable, and using thread pools.
* Synchronization: Example using ReentrantLock to control access to shared resources, and Condition to manage inter-thread signaling.
* Atomic Operations: Shows the use of atomic variables to avoid synchronization, including solving the ABA problem with AtomicStampedReference.
* Concurrent Collections: Examples of using ConcurrentHashMap and BlockingQueue to handle concurrent access.
* Communication Utilities:
  * CountDownLatch: Allows one or more threads to wait for a set of operations in other threads to complete.
  * CyclicBarrier: Synchronizes threads at a common barrier point.
  * Semaphore: Controls access to a resource pool, with examples demonstrating resource limits.
  * Exchanger: Facilitates data exchange between two threads.
* Fork/Join Framework:
  * Parallel Sum Calculation: Splits an array and calculates the sum in parallel using RecursiveTask.
  * Parallel Merge Sort: Implements merge sort using RecursiveAction to split and merge parts of an array concurrently.
  * Directory Size Calculation: Recursively computes the size of a directory and its subdirectories using RecursiveTask.

## Running Examples

Each example in this project is organized into its own package and can be executed using Maven. For instance, to run the `BioServer` example, use:

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="example.net.bio.BioServer"
```
